# ABC News Project

Welcome to the ABC News project repository! This project is part of a 30-day challenge embarked upon by two beginners in web development. Our goal is to create a simple news website called ABC News.

## Description

ABC News is a basic news website designed to showcase various news articles across different categories, such as technology, business, and more. The project aims to demonstrate our learning progress and skills in HTML, CSS, and basic web development concepts.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files and directories:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the ABC News website.
- `style.css`: The CSS file containing styles for the ABC News website.
- `header.html`: HTML file containing the header section of the website.
- `footer.html`: HTML file containing the footer section of the website.
- `images/`: Directory containing image files used in the project.

## Usage

To view the website locally, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. You can navigate through the different news articles using the sidebar links.
